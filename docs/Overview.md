## 8/10 Meeting

Both the server and client are written in TypeScript, a strongly typed programming language that ultimately gets transpiled into JavaScript

```ts
// JS = untyped language
 
var message = "Hello!"

// TS = typed language

var message = "Hello!"

var typedMessage: string = "Hello!"
```

### What is React? (HTML, CSS, JS)

HTML = General structure of website (text, images, etc.)

CSS = Styling of website (spacing, colors, fonts, dimensions, etc.)

JS = Application logic (perform functions, change UI - user interface)

React = A framework responsible for creating apps that are reactive
